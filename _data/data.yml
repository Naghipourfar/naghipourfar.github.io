    summary: |
      Hi! I'm Mohsen. Right now, I am a computer engineering B.Sc. student and research assistant at bAIo lab under supervision of [Dr. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi](http://ce.sharif.edu/faculty/ali-sharifi-zarchi/) in Sharif University of Technology. I am also research assistant under supervision of [Prof. Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/institute/staff/staff/ma/2494/index.html) at ML group of Institute of Computational Biology (ICB), Helmholtz Zentrum Munich.

        My research interests are **Computational Biology**, **Deep Learning** and its applications in other areas like **Computer Vision** and **Natual Language Processing**.

education:
    - degree: BSc in Computer Engineering
      university: Sharif University of Technology
      time: 2015 - 2020
      details: |
        I'm studying computer (software) Engineering at [Computer Engineering Department](http://ce.sharif.edu/). I expect to graduate in February 2020.

        **Notable Courses:** Probability and Statistics, Artificial Intelligence, Introduction to Bioinformatics (Graduate Course), Deep Learning (Graduate Course).

    - degree: Diploma in Mathematics & Physics
      university: AE Highschool
      time: 2011 - 2015
      details: |
        I have studied mathematics and physics in [AE highschool](http://www.aehighschool.com/). During my diploma studies, I have done some Robocup projects such as 2D soccer simulation, building air drone and etc. We have attended to numerous competetions including Sharif Cup, Iran open and International Robocup challenge.

experiences:
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: December 2018 - Present
      company: Helmholtz Zentrum Munich - Institute of Computational Biology (ICB)
      details: |
        From December 2018, I joined machine learning group at ICB under supervision of **[Prof. Fabian J. Theis](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/institute/staff/staff/ma/2494/Prof.%20Dr.%20Dr.-Theis/index.html)**. I started working as research assistant in deep learning remotely. I was researching in applications of deep generative models in single-cell world. We developed novel deep learning architectures and compared them with various state-of-the art models like scVI and SAUCIE on single-cell data. We have also been researching on transfer learning and a novel technique in deep learning called architecture surgery. The projects I have been working on are:

        **[scGen](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0494-8)**: scGen is a deep generative model used for single-cell perturbation prediction across cell types, studies and species. It was published in **Nature Methods** in July 2019. I was working on scGen reproducibility and make a tensorflow-based package for scGen since it was submitted before I joined the group.

        **[trVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01791)**: After scGen project we extended scGen with a novel deep learning architecture called trVAE which is submitted to **Nature Machine Intelligence**. trVAE is also a deep generative model which learns mapping between multiple different styles (conditions). trVAE can be used for style transfer in images, predciting single-cell perturbations responses and batch removal.

    - role: Research Assistant
      time: December 2017 - Present
      company: bAIo-lab, Sharifi University of Technology
      details: |
        I joined bAIo lab
            under supervision of [Dr. Ali Sharifi Zarchi](http://ce.sharif.edu/faculty/ali-sharifi-zarchi/). I have done several projects at bAIo lab including:

        **[FSNN](https://github.com/Naghipourfar/Feature-Selection)**: In this project, we used simple random feature selection on [TCGA](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) gene expression dataset in order to select K (K < 50) features. Then we used a simple MLP classifier on preprocessed dataset. The network's accuracy on 37 cancer types was 93.2% which was comparative to netowrk's accuracy on dataset without selecting a small subset. The goal of the project was to compare results of the networks and classical machine learning algorithms and propose an information theoric proof for the problem.

        **[DrugNet](https://github.com/Naghipourfar/DrugNet)**: DrugNet is a deep learning architecture which is used to predict drug efficacy on cancer cell lines. In this project, We have used [CCLE](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle), [GDSC](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) and [CMap](https://www.broadinstitute.org/connectivity-map-cmap) dataset in order to train our network.

        **DrugGeNet**: DrugGeNet is a deep generative model which is used to perform style transfer on cancer cell lines after specific concentration of drug injected to that cell line.

        **[SeqLearner](http://seqlearner.readthedocs.io)**: SeqLearner is a multitask learning package for semi-supervised learning on biological sequences SeqLearner is a high-level API, written in Python and capable of running on different embedding methods such as Freq2Vec, Word2Vec, Sent2Vec and etc. It also provides some visualizations to analyze the embedding.

    - role: Research Assistant
      time: June 2018 - March 2019
      company: Digital Media Lab (DML) - Sharif University of Technology
      details: |
        I joined [Digital Media Lab (DML)](http://dml.ir) under supervision of [Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee](http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/) as a research assistant. I have done several projects in DML

        **[HiCPack](http://hicpack.readthedocs.io)**: HiCPack is a python-based package for analyzing Hi-C data. HiCPack accepts SRR numbers (or fastq files) as input and download its corresponding fastq files automatically. Then it will execute analysis steps such as alignment, builing raw contact maps, normalization, background correction, TAD calling and visualization.

        **CED**: CED (Convolution Encoder Decoder) is a deep learning architecture used for removing artifacts in MEG data which is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers.   Removing Artifacts from MEG data using deep convolutional encoder decoder networks(CED). (Summer 2018)
